## Biography
<p>
Hi, my name is Jelena Savic and I'm a current LBS student. I was born in 1996 in Belgrade, Serbia. I graduated from [School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en#gsc.tab=0), and started my career working in the IT industry. After a year, I decided to make a shift to the world of *Business and Finance*. **Master in Analytics and Management** seamed as an ideal option, and after extensive preparation, I was accepted to her dream school.

My professional skills include:

1. Programming skills in various languages (Java, Python, C++ etc.)
2. Analytical thinking
3. Collaborative skills
4. Creativity

After compleiting the **MAM** program, I plan to continue my career in the consulting industry.
